##Development Sandbox
Setting up the source for a development sandbox with Eclipse. This will allow Objectify testing with out building a jar.

1. Link Objectify src. It might look something like this sandboxproject/src_objectify = git/objectify/src/main/java
2. If your using GWT, Link Objectify resources. It might look something like this  sandboxproject/src_objectify_resources = git/objectify/src/main/resources
 - Note the supersource will look like it has errors because of the re-rooted classes.  
3. Add the needed dependencies in the sandbox project via maven or gradle. 


##GWT
Add this to your GWT project module.

    ```
    <inherits name="com.googlecode.objectify.Objectify"/>
    ```
