 * <p>This is the main "business end" of Objectify.  It lets you load, save, and delete your typed POJO entities.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code Objectify} instances are obtained by calling the static method {@code ObjectifyService.ofy()}.  This method
 * will always provide the correct {@code Objectify} instance for a given transactional context.  You can run
 * transactions by calling {@code Objectify.transact()} or {@code Objectify.transactNew()}; calling {@code ObjectifyService.ofy()}
 * within {@code Work.run()} will produce the correct {@code Objectify} instance associated with the correct transaction.</p>
 *
 * <p>Objectify instances are immutable but they are NOT thread-safe.  The instance contains
 * a session cache of entities that have been loaded from the instance.  You should never access an Objectify
 * from more than one thread simultaneously.</p>
