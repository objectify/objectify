 * This interface provides a return value for asynchronous Objectify calls,

 * of {@code Future} throw checked exceptions, rendering the class prohibitively
 * painful to use in business logic.  This interface fixes that problem, and implementors
 * automatically unwrap ExecutionExceptions (checked exceptions will be wrapped in a
 * new RuntimeException).
