/**
 * <p>A simple interface that defines a condition test for a field value or whole
 * entity.  For example, you could have a class that tests against null values called IfNull.
 * This interface is used by the @IgnoreSave, @Index, and @Unindex annotations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The matching engine will call both methods; if either return true the condition
 * is considered true.</p>
 *
 * <p>All implementations of this interface will be created with {@code ObjectifyFactory.construct()}.
 * If the implementation also implements the {@code InitializeIf} interface, the {@code init()} method
 * will be called immediately after construction.</p>
