	 * <p>This method forces Objectify to (or not to) hybridize the query into a keys-only fetch plus batch get.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>If Objectify knows you are fetching an entity type that can be cached, it automatically converts
	 * queries into a "hybrid" of keys-only query followed by a batch fetch of the keys.  This is cheaper (keys-only
	 * results are 1/7th the price of a full fetch) and, if the cache hits, significantly faster.  However,
	 * there are some circumstances in which you may wish to force behavior one way or another:</p>
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Issuing a kindless query (which Objectify will not auto-hybridize) when you know a significant portion
	 * of the result set is cacheable.</li>
	 * <li>Some exotic queries cannot be made keys-only, and produce an exception from the Low-Level API when you
	 * try to execute the query.  Objectify tries to detect these cases but since the underlying implementation
	 * may change, you may need to force hybridization off in some cases.</li>
	 * <li>Hybrid queries have a slightly different consistency model than normal queries.  You may wish to
	 * force hybridization off to ensure a weakly consistent query (see below).</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>For the most part, hybridization only affects the performance and cost of queries.  However, it is possible
	 * for hybridization to alter the content of the result set.  In the HRD, queries
	 * always have EVENTUAL consistency but get operations may have either STRONG or EVENTUAL consistency depending
	 * on the read policy (see {@code Objectify.consistency()}.  The keys-only query results will always be EVENTUAL and may
	 * return data that has been deleted, but Objectify will exclude these results when the more-current batch get fails to return
	 * data.  So the count of the returned data may actually be less than the limit(), even if there are plenty of
	 * actual results.  {@code hybrid(false)} will prevent this behavior.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Note that in hybrid queries, the chunk size defines the batch size.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><b>All command objects are immutable; this method returns a new object instead of modifying the
